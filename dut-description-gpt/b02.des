This Verilog design is a 24-state finite state machine (FSM).
It has two binary inputs (input1 and input2), a clock (clk), and an asynchronous reset (reset).
The FSM output is a 5-bit register state, which encodes states S0 to S23.
On reset, the FSM returns to S0.
On each rising edge of the clock, the FSM transitions to a new state based on Boolean conditions involving input1 and input2 (AND, OR, and NOT).
Due to high complexity only required state transition and design snippet is shown.
