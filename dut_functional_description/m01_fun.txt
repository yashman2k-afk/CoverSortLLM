Requirements:
Cover the both possible values 0 and 1 FSM output outp.
Cover all possible next-state transitions from each current state according to the FSM logic and input signals (inp1, inp2).

Additional requirements:
Use Verilator’s cover property syntax.
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging $inside and event controls such as @(posedge clk).
Ensure coverage is based on functional behavior, not just input combinations.
