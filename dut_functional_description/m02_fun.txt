Requirements:
Cover all possible output values(0 and 1) of U.
Cover all state transitions according to the FSM logic and LINEA input.
Ensure functional coverage, not just input combinations.

Additional Requirements:
Use Verilator’s cover property syntax.
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging $inside and event controls such as @(posedge clk).
