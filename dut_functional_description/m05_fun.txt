Requirements:
Cover all possible counter values (0 to 15) when the counter is enabled.
Cover overflow condition when counting up (up_down = 1) and count reaches 15.
Cover underflow condition when counting down (up_down = 0) and count reaches 0.
Cover transitions when the counter is enabled in both counting directions (up_down = 1 or 0).

Additional Requirements:
Use Verilator’s cover property syntax.
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging $inside and event controls such as @(posedge clk).
