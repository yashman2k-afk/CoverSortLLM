Requirements:
Cover all possible FSM states (S0 to S31).
Cover all state transitions according to the FSM logic and inputs (in_a and in_b).
Cover asynchronous reset functionality.
Cover the assertion of output flags (carry_flag, zero_flag, overflow_flag, special_out) in relevant states.
States with identical next-state behavior may be grouped to create more concise cover properties.

Additional Requirements:
Use SystemVerilog cover property syntax (e.g., cover property).
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging $past(state) and $inside operators with event controls such as @(posedge clk) or @(posedge reset).
