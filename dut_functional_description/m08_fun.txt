Requirements:
Cover all FSM states: WAIT, GO, WARN, STOP.
Cover all possible lights output values: RED, YELLOW, GREEN.
Cover state transitions based on inputs.
Cover output behavior: lights must reflect the state.

Additional Requirements:
Use Verilator’s cover property syntax.
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging $inside and event controls such as @(posedge clk).
