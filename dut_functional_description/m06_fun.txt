Functional Requirements:
Cover all FSM states: INIT, ANALISI_REQ, ASSEGNA.
Cover all possible GRANT_O output values (0000, 1000, 0100, 0010, 0001).
Cover input-to-output behavior: when a request (REQUEST1–REQUEST4) is active, the corresponding grant is produced.
Optionally, cover internal registers (grant, coda0, ru*, fu*) that track requests and queue state to verify functional correctness.

##### or######### also check optional thing#########
Functional Requirements:
Cover all possible GRANT_O output values corresponding to the 4 requests (U1, U2, U3, U4).
Cover all possible state transitions (INIT, ANALISI_REQ, ASSEGNA).
Cover the behavior of the request signals (REQUEST1–REQUEST4) and their effect on the grant outputs.
Optionally, cover internal registers (grant, coda0, ru*, fu*) that track requests and queue state to verify functional correctness.

Additional Requirements:
Use Verilator’s cover property syntax.
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging $inside and event controls such as @(posedge clk).
