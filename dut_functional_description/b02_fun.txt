Requirements:
Cover all possible FSM states (S0 to S23).
Cover all state transitions according to the FSM logic and inputs (input1 and input2).
Cover reset functionality (FSM goes to S0 on reset).

Additional Requirements:
Use Verilator’s cover property syntax.
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging  $past(state), $inside and event controls such as @(posedge clk) or @(posedge reset).
