Requirements:
Cover all possible output values of OUTP and OVERFLW.
Cover all FSM state transitions between states (a, b, c, e, f, g, wf0, and wf1) according to inputs LINE1 and LINE2.
Ensure functional coverage, not just input combinations.

Additional Requirements:
Use Verilator’s cover property syntax.
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging $inside and event controls such as @(posedge clk).
