Requirements:
Cover all possible FSM states (S0 to S31).
Cover all state transitions according to the FSM logic and inputs.
Cover reset functionality.
States with identical next-state behavior may be grouped to create more concise cover properties.

Additional Requirements:
Use Verilator’s cover property syntax.
Do not modify the existing module logic.
Strictly avoid covergroups and always blocks.
Use concise style, leveraging  $past(state), $inside and event controls such as @(posedge clk) or @(posedge reset).
